# Scope and Limitations
This document outlines the scope and limitations of the key features implemented in the Predictive Analytics in Complex Environment database system. These features include triggers, cursors, functions, packages, and auditing mechanisms.

## 1. Triggers
### Scope:
- **Purpose:** Automate workflows and enforce business rules (e.g., data validation, logging changes).
- **Types:** BEFORE, AFTER, and INSTEAD OF triggers.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Automatically update disaster status when a new incident is reported.
  - Log changes to sensitive data in audit tables.
### Limitations:
- **Performance Impact:** Triggers can introduce latency, especially with complex operations on large datasets.
- **Debugging Difficulty:** Errors within triggers are harder to trace compared to procedural code.
- **Cascading Risks:** Multiple triggers on a table may cause cascading effects or infinite loops if not carefully managed.
## 2. Cursors
### Scope:
- **Purpose:** Facilitate row-by-row processing for complex queries.
- **Types:** Explicit and implicit cursors.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Processing large result sets in disaster management reporting.
  - Handling sequential data operations that require conditional checks.
### Limitations:
- **Resource Consumption:** Cursors consume more memory and processing power, which can degrade performance on large datasets.
- **Complexity:** Increases code complexity and potential for logical errors.
- **Alternative:** Whenever possible, set-based SQL operations should be preferred over cursors for efficiency.
## 3. Functions
### Scope:
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate reusable logic for modular and efficient code.
- **Types:** Scalar functions, table functions.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Calculate disaster risk levels based on multiple factors.
  - Format output data for reporting dashboards.
### Limitations:
- **Restrictions:** Cannot perform DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) inside functions.
- **Nesting Limits:** Deeply nested functions can be challenging to debug and maintain.
- **Performance:** Overuse of functions in queries can impact execution time.
## 4. Packages
### Scope:
- **Purpose:** Group related functions, procedures, and variables into a single logical unit.
- **Benefits:** Improved code organization, security, and reusability.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Package disaster prediction algorithms.
  - Group database utilities for data validation.
### Limitations:
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Packages can become large and difficult to manage if not properly modularized.
- **Loading Time:** The first call to a package may incur a performance hit as it loads into memory.
- **Versioning Issues:** Changes to package specifications require recompilation of dependent objects.
## 5. Auditing Mechanisms
### Scope:
- **Purpose:** Track changes to sensitive data, monitor user activity, and ensure compliance.
- **Techniques:**
  - Table-based auditing with triggers.
  - System-level auditing using database logs.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Log user activities during disaster response operations.
  - Track modifications to critical tables (e.g., disaster reports).
### Limitations:
- **Performance Impact:** Excessive logging can degrade system performance and increase storage needs.
- **Data Overload:** Too much audit data can be overwhelming and difficult to analyze without proper filtering.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Ensure compliance with privacy regulations when logging user data.
## Conclusion:
Understanding the scope and limitations of these features is crucial for optimizing system performance, maintaining data integrity, and ensuring efficient disaster management operations. Proper planning and best practices should guide their implementation to mitigate the identified constraints.
